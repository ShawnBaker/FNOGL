FNOGL - Frozen North OpenGL
===========================

This is an OpenGL library written in C#, based on OpenTK.
Right now it runs on Windows and IOS. The intent is to make it portable to Android as well as other platforms.

This first version consists of a set of objects for drawing 2D controls in OpenGL.

Future versions will include other things as well, most likely some common 3D objects.
